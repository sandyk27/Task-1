Introduction:
In the realm of web development, understanding the intricacies of JavaScript is crucial for creating dynamic and interactive web pages.
Two fundamental objects that play pivotal roles in this environment are the Document and Window objects.
Despite their interconnected nature, these objects serve distinct purposes. 
In this blog post, we will delve into the differences between the Document and Window objects, shedding light on their unique functionalities and
roles in the JavaScript ecosystem.

Document Object:
The Document object represents the entire HTML document within a web page. It serves as an interface to manipulate and interact with the content
of the document, allowing developers to dynamically alter the structure, style, and content of a webpage.

DOM Manipulation:
The Document object provides methods and properties to access and modify the elements and content of an HTML document. Developers can manipulate
the DOM (Document Object Model) to dynamically update the webpage without requiring a full page reload.

Element Selection:
Developers can use the Document object to select HTML elements using various methods such as getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and getElements
ByTagName. This enables targeted manipulation of specific elements within the document.

Content Modification:
Through the Document object, developers can dynamically add, remove, or modify HTML content. This capability is essential for creating interactive
 and responsive web applications.

 Event Handling:
The Document object allows for the attachment of event listeners to respond to user interactions, such as clicks, keypresses, or form submissions. 
This facilitates the creation of engaging user experiences.

Window Object:

On the other hand, the Window object represents the browser window or a frame within it. It serves as the global object in client-side JavaScript
and provides access to various properties and methods related to the browser window.

Key characteristics of the Window object:

Global Scope:
The Window object is the global object in JavaScript when running in a browser context. Variables and functions declared without the var, let, or
const keyword become properties of the Window object.

Browser Information:
The Window object provides information about the browser, such as the size of the window, the URL of the current page, and the availability of various
features like cookies and local storage.

Navigation Control:
Developers can use the Window object to control the navigation of the browser, including opening and closing windows, navigating to different URLs,
and handling browser history.

Timers and Intervals:
The Window object includes functions like setTimeout and setInterval for executing code after a specified delay or at regular intervals. This is 
crucial for implementing asynchronous behavior and managing animations.
